# intersecting-lines


Intersecting Lines, a podcast series featuring local Seattle authors, is a project made in hopes to rekindle connections between writers within Seattle, in between writers and the city itself. In such troubling times, we believe finding the overlaps of our art, of our experiences as artists, and inspirations can give solace to the writing community and beyond.
